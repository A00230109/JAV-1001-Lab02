Code Review Lab02  

The program analyses here three methods  

The first one is Encryption/Decryption 

The Encryption method asks for two things, the string to encrypt and the value of encryption which must be an integer, 

If the value of encryption is too high we ask the user to give another value but I wanted to challenge that and reduce 

this value automatically without asking the user to do so. 

If the value is > 25 I reduce this value by 26 and I loop until this value will be <= 25, why 26? because it is the number

of letters of alphabet and from a to z and return to a it will be 26 steps. 

But to facilitate things, I don’t allow user to enter others than characters and he is not allowed to enter space neither. 

I created two arrays for encryption and decryption that will contain encrypted and decrypted characters to show them up, 

because we can’t do that with a string that is immutable. 

For the decryption we do the route backwards. 

 

Calculate the sum of the elements of an array. 

The length of the array is an input from the user, and the elements of the array are randomly chosen between 0 and 100. 

We loop inside the array to get this sum. 

 

Check if an array contains a certain value. 

We loop inside the array and verify any element of the array if it is equal to this value.
